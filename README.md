Overview of the Weather Dashboard Project

Objective:
To create a weather dashboard that provides users with real-time weather information for any city using data fetched from a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap). This project demonstrates how to integrate APIs into a web application and dynamically update the user interface based on fetched data.

Key Features
Real-Time Weather Data: Fetch and display the current weather for a user-specified city.
Interactive Search: Allow users to input city names to get weather details instantly.
Weather Icons: Visual representation of the current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
Responsive Design: Adaptable user interface for desktop and mobile users.
Error Handling: Provides feedback if the entered city is invalid or if there’s a network issue.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the web page.
CSS: Styling and layout for the dashboard.
JavaScript: Logic for fetching data from the API, updating the UI, and handling user interactions.
OpenWeatherMap API: Source of real-time weather data, including current conditions, temperature, and weather icons.
Core Functionalities
Search for a City: Users can input a city name to search for weather information.
Display Weather Information:
City name.
Current temperature in Celsius.
Weather description (e.g., "clear sky", "light rain").
Weather icon corresponding to the condition.
Error Messages:
If the city is not found.
If there’s a network error or missing API key.
User Workflow
Open the weather dashboard.
Enter a city name in the input field and click the "Search" button.
View the weather details for the city, including:
Name of the city.
Temperature in °C.
Weather description.
Icon representing the weather condition.
If the city is invalid, an alert notifies the user to try again.
